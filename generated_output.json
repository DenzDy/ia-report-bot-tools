    "executive_summary": "The objective of this review was to evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls governing the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) cycle. Following the migration to a new ERP system in Q1, management requested a review of vendor onboarding and payment authorization workflows, covering transactions from January 1, 2023, to September 30, 2023, with a focus on vendor master data and high-value purchase orders.",

            "observation": "Inadequate Vendor Due Diligence: A review of 50 new vendors revealed that 12 did not have verified Tax ID numbers or evidence of Conflict of Interest (COI) disclosures on file.",
            "risk": "Potential for onboarding fraudulent entities, financial penalties from tax authorities, or undisclosed related-party transactions.",
            "risk_rating": "INADEQUATE",
            "recommendation": "Mandatory validation fields must be enabled in the ERP system to prevent vendor creation without verified tax documentation and digital COI sign-off.",

            "observation": "Fragmentation of Purchase Orders (Split POs): We identified 15 instances where multiple purchase orders were issued to the same vendor on the same day for values just below the $50,000 threshold requiring Executive VP approval.",
            "risk": "Circumvention of the Delegation of Authority (DoA) policy, leading to unauthorized spend and lack of executive oversight.",
