The report notes an established documented information management and retention framework and other activities operating effectively. Key areas for enhancement include clearer definition of roles and responsibilities, documented processes and procedures with verification and escalation steps, a centralized register/calendar/tracker for key activities, a centralized secure repository with access controls and version management, designation of a central coordinator/owner for monitoring, and implementation of an integrated automated tracking/workflow tool. Overall rating examples in the report range from Adequate to Needs Improvement depending on findings.",
