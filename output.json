            "# **Assurance Review: Third-Party Vendor Onboarding**\n\n**Business Unit:** Global Procurement Office\n\n**Date:** October 12, 2023",
            "## **Executive Summary**\n\n### **Objectives**\nTo provide independent assurance over the effectiveness of controls governing the vendor selection, due diligence, and onboarding processes.\n\n### **Background**\nFollowing the expansion into EMEA markets, the vendor landscape increased by 40%. This audit evaluates the integrity of the vendor master file and adherence to the Global Procurement Policy.\n\n### **Scope**\nTransactions and onboarding workflows completed between January 1, 2023, and September 30, 2023, specifically focusing on high-spend and high-risk categories.",
            "## **Observation 1: Missing Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Screening**\n\n**Issue:** 15% of sampled high-risk vendors lacked evidence of PEP (Politically Exposed Persons) or Sanctions screening prior to contract execution.\n\n**Risk:** Financial loss, severe legal penalties, and reputational damage resulting from engagement with sanctioned entities.\n\n**Risk Rating:** **INADEQUATE**\n\n**Recommendation:** Mandate an automated block in the ERP system that prevents vendor activation until a 'Passed' screening certificate is uploaded and verified.\n\n**Status:** Open",
            "## **Observation 2: Incomplete Financial Due Diligence**\n\n**Issue:** Financial solvency assessments were not consistently performed for critical tier-1 suppliers, with several assessments missing current year's audited financials.\n\n**Risk:** Supply chain disruption if a critical vendor faces insolvency or bankruptcy.\n\n**Risk Rating:** **FOR IMPROVEMENT**\n\n**Recommendation:** Establish a threshold-based trigger for financial reviews and implement a centralized repository for annual financial monitoring documents.\n\n**Status:** In Progress",
            "## **Recommendations Summary**\n\n1.  **Systemic Controls:** Implement hard-stops in the Procurement Portal to enforce compliance with screening protocols.\n2.  **Due Diligence Standards:** Update the Procurement Policy to define specific 'Financial Solvency' criteria for Tier-1 suppliers.\n3.  **Training:** Conduct mandatory training for Procurement Officers on the updated Sanctions Screening workflow.",

            "## **Executive Summary**\n\n### **Objectives**\nTo provide consultative insights on streamlining the handoff from Sales to Customer Success and identifying opportunities to reduce customer churn through process automation.\n\n### **Background**\nThe division reported a 5% increase in churn. Management requested an advisory review to identify process bottlenecks and efficiency gains.\n\n### **Scope**\nReview of the internal handoff documentation, customer health scoring methodology, and the first 90 days of the customer journey.",
            "## **Observation 1: Sales-to-Success Knowledge Gap**\n\n**Issue:** The transition of customer requirements from Sales to Success is currently manual and often lacks specific 'success criteria' defined during the sales cycle.\n\n**Risk:** High churn risk due to misaligned expectations and delayed time-to-value for the customer.\n\n**Risk Rating:** **FOR IMPROVEMENT**\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a standardized 'Transition Playbook' within the CRM that automatically populates key customer goals for the Success Team.\n\n**Status:** Advisory Insight",
            "## **Observation 2: Underutilized Predictive Health Scoring**\n\n**Issue:** While a health scoring tool exists, it relies heavily on lagging indicators (e.g., historical login frequency) rather than leading indicators (e.g., support ticket sentiment).\n\n**Risk:** Missed opportunities to proactively intervene before a customer decides to cancel their subscription.\n\n**Risk Rating:** **ADEQUATE**\n\n**Recommendation:** Integrate Sentiment Analysis and API-usage depth into the Health Score algorithm to provide more predictive insights.\n\n**Status:** Advisory Insight",
            "## **Recommendations Summary**\n\n1.  **Process Integration:** Automate the 'Account Handoff' task trigger in the CRM to ensure 100% visibility of new accounts.\n2.  **Metric Enhancement:** Shift from static health reporting to dynamic, AI-driven predictive modeling for customer sentiment.\n3.  **Cross-Functional Alignment:** Establish monthly syncs between Sales and CS leads to review 'Post-Mortems' of churned accounts.",
