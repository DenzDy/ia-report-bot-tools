            "# Assurance Review: P2P Lifecycle & Vendor Management\n**Business Unit:** Global Procurement & Supply Chain\n**Date:** October 24, 2023",
            "# Executive Summary\n**Objectives:** To evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls governing the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) cycle.\n\n**Background:** Following the migration to the new ERP system in Q1, management requested a formal review of vendor onboarding and payment authorization workflows.\n\n**Scope:** The audit covered transactions processed between January 1, 2023, and September 30, 2023, focusing on vendor master data and high-value purchase orders.",
            "# Observation 1: Inadequate Vendor Due Diligence\n**Issue:** A review of 50 new vendors revealed that 12 did not have verified Tax ID numbers or evidence of Conflict of Interest (COI) disclosures on file.\n\n**Risk:** Potential for onboarding fraudulent entities, financial penalties from tax authorities, or undisclosed related-party transactions.\n\n**Risk Rating:** INADEQUATE\n\n**Recommendation:** Mandatory validation fields must be enabled in the ERP system to prevent vendor creation without verified tax documentation and digital COI sign-off.\n\n**Status:** OPEN",
            "# Observation 2: Fragmentation of Purchase Orders (Split POs)\n**Issue:** We identified 15 instances where multiple purchase orders were issued to the same vendor on the same day for values just below the $50,000 threshold requiring Executive VP approval.\n\n**Risk:** Circumvention of the Delegation of Authority (DoA) policy, leading to unauthorized spend and lack of executive oversight.\n\n**Risk Rating:** FOR IMPROVEMENT\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement system-based alerts for aggregate daily spend by vendor and perform monthly forensic data analytics to identify potential DoA bypass patterns.\n\n**Status:** OPEN",
            "# Recommendations Summary\n1. **System Controls:** Enforce mandatory documentation fields for all new vendor registrations.\n2. **Compliance Monitoring:** Establish a monthly 'Spend Exception Report' to be reviewed by the Finance Director.\n3. **Training:** Re-train procurement officers on the updated Delegation of Authority (DoA) limits.",

            "# Advisory Engagement: AI Integration & Data Ethics\n**Business Unit:** Digital Transformation & Innovation\n**Date:** November 12, 2023",
            "# Executive Summary\n**Objectives:** To provide consultative insights on the emerging Generative AI roadmap and assess the readiness of the data governance framework.\n\n**Background:** The business unit is piloting several Large Language Model (LLM) applications to automate customer service interactions.\n\n**Scope:** Review of the proposed AI Ethics Charter, data privacy protocols for model training, and alignment with upcoming regional AI regulations.",
            "# Observation 1: Data Privacy in Model Training\n**Issue:** Current pilot projects use anonymized but not fully de-identified customer datasets, which may still pose re-identification risks in complex LLM outputs.\n\n**Risk:** Potential breach of GDPR/CCPA privacy standards and reputational damage if sensitive customer patterns are inadvertently exposed.\n\n**Risk Rating:** FOR IMPROVEMENT\n\n**Recommendation:** Adopt differential privacy techniques and synthetic data generation for all model training phases to ensure zero exposure of PII (Personally Identifiable Information).\n\n**Status:** IN PROGRESS",
            "# Observation 2: Absence of 'Human-in-the-Loop' for High-Impact Decisions\n**Issue:** The proposed workflow for automated credit limit adjustments via AI lacks a formal human override or secondary verification step.\n\n**Risk:** Algorithmic bias leading to discriminatory lending practices and lack of accountability for automated financial decisions.\n\n**Risk Rating:** INADEQUATE\n\n**Recommendation:** Formalize a 'Human-in-the-Loop' (HITL) protocol where AI-driven credit adjustments exceeding a specific variance must be approved by a Senior Credit Officer.\n\n**Status:** OPEN",
            "# Recommendations Summary\n1. **Data Security:** Upgrade to advanced de-identification and synthetic data tools for R&D.\n2. **Governance Framework:** Finalize the Corporate AI Ethics Charter and appoint an AI Ethics Committee.\n3. **Risk Mitigation:** Implement HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) checkpoints for all financial and legal AI outputs.",
