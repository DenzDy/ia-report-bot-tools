        "Report Content": "# Internal Audit Report: Assurance Review of Global Accounts Payable\n\n## 1. Executive Summary\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe primary objective of this audit was to evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls within the Accounts Payable (AP) department, specifically focusing on vendor master file maintenance, invoice processing, and payment disbursements.\n\n**Background:**\nThe Global Accounts Payable team processes approximately $150M in monthly disbursements across 12 regions. Recent system migrations have introduced new automated workflows that require validation to ensure financial integrity and compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) requirements.\n\n**Scope:**\nThe audit covered transactions and processes from January 1, 2023, to June 30, 2023. Specific focus areas included the segregation of duties (SoD) within the ERP system, the vendor onboarding process, and the accuracy of duplicate payment detection controls.\n\n## 2. Details\n\n| Observation | Risk | Risk Rating | Recommendation | Status |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Lack of Segregation of Duties (SoD):** Three senior analysts possess both the ability to create new vendors and process payments. | High risk of unauthorized disbursements and fraudulent activities. | **INADEQUATE** | Revoke payment processing rights from users responsible for vendor master file maintenance immediately. | Open |\n| **Stale Vendor Data:** Approximately 15% of the vendor master file consists of inactive vendors (no activity > 24 months), increasing the risk of data phishing. | Moderate risk of administrative errors and potential fraud targets. | **FOR IMPROVEMENT** | Implement an automated quarterly purge or deactivation process for vendors with no activity over 18 months. | In-Progress |\n| **Duplicate Invoice Detection:** Automated system alerts for duplicate invoices were found to be bypassed manually by junior staff without secondary approval. | High risk of financial loss due to double payments. | **INADEQUATE** | Update the ERP configuration to require a supervisor's digital signature for any duplicate invoice override. | Open |\n\n## 3. Recommendations\n\n1. **System Access Review:** Conduct a comprehensive User Access Review (UAR) for all Finance team members to ensure the \"Principle of Least Privilege\" is enforced.\n2. **Training:** Provide mandatory fraud awareness and system security training for all Accounts Payable staff.\n3. **Policy Update:** Formalize the AP Desktop Procedures to include the new override requirements for system-flagged duplicates.\n\n## 4. Management Action Plan\n\n*   **Action 1:** The IT Security team will remove conflicting permissions for the identified senior analysts by October 15th.\n*   **Action 2:** The AP Manager will initiate a cleanup of the Vendor Master File by end of Q4.\n*   **Action 3:** A new approval workflow for duplicate overrides will be developed and tested by the ERP support team by November 1st."

        "Report Content": "# Internal Audit Report: Advisory Engagement - IT Procurement & SaaS Management\n\n## 1. Executive Summary\n\n**Objectives:**\nThis advisory engagement aimed to assess the efficiency of the IT Procurement lifecycle and provide strategic recommendations for optimizing the management of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) subscriptions.\n\n**Background:**\nFollowing a rapid shift to remote work, the organization's SaaS spend increased by 40%. The business unit requested Internal Audit's expertise to identify cost-saving opportunities and process bottlenecks without the formal constraints of a compliance audit.\n\n**Scope:**\nThe review focused on the end-to-end procurement process, from requisition to contract renewal, and evaluated the current tools used for license tracking and utilization monitoring.\n\n## 2. Details\n\n| Observation | Risk | Risk Rating | Recommendation | Status |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Decentralized SaaS Purchasing:** Various departments are purchasing software independently using corporate credit cards, bypassing the IT Procurement vetting process. | Financial inefficiency and potential security vulnerabilities via 'Shadow IT'. | **FOR IMPROVEMENT** | Centralize all software procurement under a unified IT approval workflow. | Advisory Only |\n| **Underutilized Licenses:** Analysis shows that 22% of active licenses for the primary Project Management tool have not been accessed in 60 days. | Unnecessary operational expenditure. | **FOR IMPROVEMENT** | Implement a monthly utilization audit to reclaim and reallocate licenses from inactive users. | Under Review |\n| **Standardized Vendor Terms:** Most contracts are negotiated ad-hoc without a standardized set of GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) requirements. | Minor risk of unfavorable legal or service terms. | **ADEQUATE** | Develop a 'Standard Vendor Addendum' containing minimum security and service level requirements for all IT vendors. | Completed |\n\n## 3. Recommendations\n\n1. **SaaS Management Tooling:** Evaluate and implement a SaaS Management Platform (SMP) to provide real-time visibility into software spend and usage across the enterprise.\n2. **Policy Enhancement:** Update the Corporate Procurement Policy to explicitly prohibit the use of P-Cards for software subscriptions above a $500 threshold.\n3. **Stakeholder Alignment:** Establish a monthly sync between IT, Finance, and Legal to review upcoming high-value renewals 90 days in advance.\n\n## 4. Management Action Plan\n\n*   **Action 1:** IT Procurement will draft a centralized procurement policy for executive review by November 30th.\n*   **Action 2:** The IT Asset Management team will begin a pilot program using a discovery tool to identify unauthorized software across the network.\n*   **Action 3:** Finance will provide a report on all 'Software' categorized expenses on P-Cards to identify and migrate them to the formal procurement system."
